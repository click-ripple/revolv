class ImportProxy(object):
    """
    An ImportProxy is a class which acts as a delegation proxy for an import.
    It is sometimes the case that we have to import something from a module
    that would create a circular dependency, but that it shouldn't matter,
    because we do not actually use the dependency immediately.

    ImportProxy solves this by essentially performing laxy evaluation of an
    import - for example, we could declare a = ImportProxy("b.c.d", "e"): this
    would in general be equivalent to calling `from b.c.d import e; a = e`. If
    there was a circular dependency in which b.c.d imported something from the
    same module in which a was declared, then the declaration would cause an error,
    but using an ImportProxy, it does not.

    Another example:

    # in revolv/base/factories.py
    from revolv.base.profile import Profile
    class ProfileFactory:
        profile = Profile

    # in revolv/base/profile.py
    # from revolv.base.factories import ProfileFactory # would create circular dependency, but now we don't need it
    class Profile(models.model):
        factories = ImportProxy("revolv.base.factories", "ProfileFactory")
