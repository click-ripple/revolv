        Given a WebTest form which was rendered from a django ModelForm,
        fill out as much of it as possible from the model, then return the filled
        out form.

        This method will look at the fields of the form, and for every field, it will
        check for a corresponding field on the model. If that exists, it will try to set the
        field of the form to be the corresponding value from the model instance. It
        makes no guarentee about whether the fields can be set, and will error if they
        cannot.

        If model_name is provided, it should be the name of a model, like "Project". This function
        will check to see if there is a webtest FormFiller defined in revolv/lib/webtest/form_fillers.py,

        have things like project cover_photo which are required by the form but default to none -
        the form filler will take care of populating the form with a dummy cover_photo.

        If warn_of_errors is true, this method will print out all the errors of the ModelForm
        which it is supposed to be filling out. Can be useful to triage which fields of the form
        are ignored by the default filling algorithm and thus must be used by a webtest FormFiller.
