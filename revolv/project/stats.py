    A class to abstract the calculation of different energy statistics about a
    project, based on the kilowatt output of the project. The idea is that in order
    to engage donors, it makes sense for RE-volv to display the impact of a solar
    project in terms of not only power output but dollars saved per month, equivalent
    acres of trees that could be planted, etc.

    This is a utility class that takes in a kilowatt number (or, can accept instantiation
    from a Project or a Project queryset) and makes different statistics about the
    kilowatt power output available through calculations. Another advantage is that if
    we need to change the calculations, the price of electricity, or anything else
    related to the project stats, we can do so here and only here.

    Note: it's important to make the distinction between kilowatt output and kilowatt-hour
    output. Kilowatt (kW) is a measure of the power of the solar panel: i.e. its ability to
    produce energy. If you have a 25 kW solar panel array, then it will be able to produce
    a lot more electricity than a 1 kW solar panel array in the same amount of time (in fact,
    about 25x more). Apparently residential solar panels are usually between 5 and 25 kW,
    usually, at the time of writing.

    Kilowatt-hours (kWh), however, are a measure of energy (in this case, electric energy that comes
    through residential power outlets). A solar panel array rated at 1 kW power output will
    produce 1 kWh of electricty in one hour (this is why it's called a kilowatt-hour). If you're
    scientifically inclined, 1 kWh is equal to 3600 kilojoules, or the work done by a force
    of 3,600,000 newtons when the force is exerted over 1 meter, or the energy required to lift
    3,600,000 small apples into the air by one meter. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt_hour and
